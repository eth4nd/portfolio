			 This is my Entreprenuership Project. For this project our objective was to think about a problem in the world today and come up with a solution to it whether it would be computerized, mechanically, or both. My group and I created the LifeSensor, which is a system integrated into a car that detects to see if you left your pet or baby in the car after you parked. Basically what it does is, after you park it will first check to see if it dark outside. If it were to be dark outside it would leave the car how it is. However, if it were sunny or hot outside, the system will go through its safety protocols. These safety protocols include ultrasonic sensors which will check to see if there is any movement in the car. Had it detected any movement, it will turn on an alarm, and an emergency cooling system that doesn't require the power of the car. In our car prototype, the flashlight was used to simulate the alarm going off, while the fan was to simulate an emergency cooling system.  As you can see in the video attached to the link below, the car does not turn on the fan and flashlight, when the light sensor is covered (simulating darkness). For this project, I was the group manager, where I coded the program, helped construct the prototype, and finally assist my group to make sure that we were going to stay on task to complete the project by deadline. I applied a lot of engineering concepts in this particular project. First, I was able to use my RobotC program language taught by my teacher Ms. Chou to program the code needed for the safety system. Next, I was able to work with the VEX programmable parts and integrate them into the prototype car such as light sensors, ultrasonic sensors, buttons, and more. Finally, I applied my previous knowledge from my previous projects to help construct our final prototype. I feel that this project was the ultimate culmination of everything that I had learned in POE. It was such a great feeling to merge the 2 different fields of engineering. I was able to use the regular engineering side of the academy to construct the prototype, and use the computer engineering side to code the program needed for the safety protocols. From group manager's perspective, I took the next step into leading a team once more, and feel that I did all that I could to put my team in a position to compete for a spot in the showcase. Although, we were not able to make it to the showcase, I know that we worked hard and did the best we could to solve a growing problem today. The LifeSensor, given the proper technology and expertise, could be elevated to a better product for the market. With improvements such as an actual creation of the emergency cooling system and alarm, integration of infrared sensors, and better interior sensors other than ultrasonics, the LifeSensor has the capability to be licensed to other car companies already existing in the market.

			 This is my Scratch Project. For this project, my partner and I created a mini game from a Scratch Program. Essentially, the goal was to create a game where the user had to be very quick and decisive when encountering obstacles in their path. A timer was set in order for them to make quick decisions, and when time ran out, they would be met with a ghoul, indicating a loss. Throughout this project, I was really able to emmerse myself in fundamental processes of coding, as there were already built in blocks of code ready for use. I feel that the most important takeaway I got from this project was the actual foundation for programming, as well as ideas on how to implement blocks of pre-made code, into an actual game/app for other users. This project was specifically made for my Computer Science course, taken at Dublin High School.

			 This is my App Inventor Project. For this project, my partner and I had to develop an app that functioned like most simple apps on the existing market. For this app, we chose to create a app like a questionaire. It would ask the user questions, and they would have time to answer them. There would be a point received for every correct answer, and a point taken away from the user, for every incorrect answer. The app, being very simple, was solely developed for our benefit. This was used as a teaching tool, in order for my partner and I to understand, the basic fundamental program language from App Inventor. In this project, App Inventor was used to help us create this specific app. The questions presented in this app, ranged from a variety of easy to difficult questions, and progressively got harder, as you moved on. As well as the scratch project above, this project was made in my Computer Science Course.

			 This is my Text Adventure Project. For this project, my partner and I had to create a game that simulated a story. We had decided to make it based off of the popular Jumanji story, and incorporate different weapons and obstacles you had to face just like the movie had done. As shown in the code, you were able to pick multiple choices such as weapons and paths. These weapons and paths would then lead to if you were going to live or die in the game. This game as a whole was solely based on your choices as the user, and how they influenced your results in the game. This project really helped me work on my partner skills, while working with another person for a project as well as practice my fundamental python skills. This project was completed in my computer science course at Dublin High.

			 This is my Hangman Project. For this project, my partner and I had to create similar version of the hangman game. The word that we had chosen was supposed to relate within the disney theme. This was so that it would connect and relate to the modern audience as well as make it have a slight rigor. At the same time, we have received a lot of feedback regarding our game, and how it was hard at first because of the broad topic, but with more tries, they were able to correctly guess the word, which was our ultimate goal for this project. This is mainly due to the fact that they could have thought of disney princesses, superheroes, and the sort. This project really helped me stengthen my skills working with someone else as well as help me strengthen my fundamental and advanced python skills. This project was completed in my computer science course at Dublin High.
