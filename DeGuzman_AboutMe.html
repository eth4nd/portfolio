			 My name is Ethan DeGuzman and welcome to my engineering portfolio! Here is where I will documenting and updating most of my work that  could contribute to my working goal of getting a job in the computer engineering field. I plan on working towards a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at a 4 year college university in California. I was first immersed in this particular field of engineering with the help of my Dad, who works as a Computer Engineer Director. Whenever I had gone to visit him at work, I had always been fascinated by all of the complicated amounts of code that he had created and tested for functionality. Since then, working with computers was something I wanted to do in the future. The fact that coding teaches you how to think and persevere through problems in order for something to work, really motivated me to continue on this path to becoming a computer engineer.
â€‹
      Throughout my high school career at Dublin High School, I have been in the National Honor Society and California Scholarship Federation clubs which are 2 of the most honorary clubs on campus. These clubs both allow me to express myself at school as well as do community service. One of the most important accomplishments to me was being apart of the 2019 Class Engineering Academy Cohort under the Computer Science Pathway. Being apart of the academy, really helps me get 1 step closer to becoming a computer engineer with the help of my 2 amazing teachers Ms. Chou and Mr. Brown. Another thing that really helped me get a sense of what is to come in the computer engineering industry was shadowing over my Dad's job at Big Switch Networks in Santa Clara, CA. There, I was able to meet a lot of people, such as the CEO of the company, vice presidents of numerous areas such as sales, engineering, products, and other employees. The employees there, were kind enough to give me a tour around the building which was great to see. 

        Being a computer engineer is not easy, as you need to possess a multiple amount of skills for the jobs available in the field. One of the reasons why I want to have a job in the field of computer engineering would be that it fits my skillset really well. When it comes to group projects or work, I like to put myself in a position that would lead the team and manage how everything is going. I tend to be very patient, adaptable, and cooperative which really helps especially when you are leading a team. For my entrepreneurship project under the POE 2016-2017 projects tab on this website, I was assigned as group manager, and was able to complete the project with my team in an efficient and productive way. Another great skill that I posses is public speaking. I am usually very calm, but thorough at the same time when it comes to speaking in public. Whenever I am needed to present a project to the class, or just to speak in general, I believe that the more confident you speak the better the performance will be. During my late elementary and early middle school life, I would take speech and debate classes which helped strengthen my speaking skills at a young age which I then used to develop as I got older. Having all of these skills is a great necessity especially for a job in computer engineering. 

          I believe I set myself up in the perfect situation in achieveing my life goal into becoming a computer engineer here at Dublin High School, as I will continue to grow and learn all the important aspects of engineering in general. Everything on this website reflects my work and who I am as a person. Thank you for your time and feel free to read and observe the other tabs on the website!
